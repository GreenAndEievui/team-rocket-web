    <h1>Planning Phase</h1>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This project is designed to make it easier for people to report lost
        pets. Instead of having to deal with a phone number, the user just scans
        a QR code and fills out a couple of text fields. The experience is
        designed to be the most streamlined for the reporting user. This is to
        hopefully allow the most reports possible as they require little effort.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other user end is the app used by people who lost their pet. They
        fill in the information for their pet and are given a QR code. When
        someone makes a report that they found the pet, the app sends a
        notification to the user.
    </p>

    <h2>Body</h2>

    <h3>Feature 1: Report when the user loses a pet</h3>
    <p>
        The user who lost their pet makes a report on the app. The user scans
        the QR code to make the report.
    </p>
    Pros:
    <ul>
        <li>Accessible</li>
        <li>Easy to report the lost pet</li>
    </ul>
    Cons:
    <ul>
        <li>QR codes could be difficult to scan from a distance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Feature 2: Forum for found pets</h3>
    <p>
        If a user finds a pet, they can post it to a feed that has posts from
        local users of lost pets. Someone who loses their pet can check this
        feed as well as the report made with their QR code.
    </p>

    <h3>Feature 3: Pet profiles</h3>
    <p>
        People can make profiles for their pets. If a similar pet is reported on
        the forum they can get a notification.
    </p>
    Pros:
    <ul><li>More convenient for users. They can find their pet without needing to put out the posters.</li></ul>
    Cons:
    <ul><li>Users may receive many notifications for pets that arenâ€™t theirs</li></ul>

    <h3>Proposed Business Partnership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Local Animal shelters</li>
        <li>PetSmart</li>
        <li>Lake Humane Society</li>
        <li>Canine Cuties</li>
        <li>Nine Lives Rescue</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        At this point the plan is to build an app that lets users report lost
        pets, post about found pets on a public forum, and create profiles for
        their pets. If local support is needed, we may be able to reach out to
        PetSmart or other local animal shelters. We will use the waterfall method
        to create this application, which means we will go through the planning,
        analysis, design, development, and support phases. Our team will keep
        files on GitHub and use Discord for communication.
